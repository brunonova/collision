Installation instruction
========================

1.  Make sure that python3, along with pip, is installed.

2.  Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

        sudo pip3 install .
    
    Or, if you want to install the game to the home folder as a user, run:
    
        pip3 install --user .
    
    If the `pip3` command is not available in your system, use `pip` instead.
